# Toxic-Comment-Classification-LR-CNN-LSTM

This is a repository containing an implementation of different deep learning models for classifying toxic comments in text. 

The models implemented are:

1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

The dataset used is the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge from Kaggle, which contains a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The goal is to build a model which can accurately classify whether a comment contains toxic behavior or not.

*Requirements*

* Python 3
* TensorFlow 2
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
